start.hello.1=Hello, I'm Prism! I'll attempt to help you manage your server with ease~ Make sure you remember to submit any bugs you find, or they might not get fixed!
start.hello.2=Now that all the formalities are out of the way, lets get started on my inital setup.

start.host=In order for me to establish a secure connection, I must generate an SSL certificate. Please input the IP address of your server. This will be the address that you use to connect to my web interface. I attempted to find your address; is {host} correct? If not, please enter the corrected address. Otherwise press enter.
start.host.prompt=Host
start.host.correct=I was right? Yay!

start.secret=Okay! *checks that off the list* Now, should I generate a secret for you? If not, please tell me one now.
start.secret.prompt=Secret Key
start.secret.generate=Hmm. Okay, I'll try... *thinks for a moment* How about {secret_key}? Yeah, that'll do. Why couldn't you do that? It's kinda fun!
start.secret.done=Oooo, {secret_key}}? That's a very nice secret. I'll try not to tell anyone. *winks*

start.login.username='Okay, next. (Don\'t worry, I\'m as bored as you...) It says here I need to ask you for a username and password. So?
start.login.username.prompt=Username
start.login.password.prompt=Password
start.login.password.default.1=You've done this before, haven't you? :3
start.login.password.default.2=Okay, I guess. In reality, that's really insecure, but whatever. Just don't do that in production, please? Either way, I'm not responsible for your password security.
start.login.password.default.3=... Anyways...

start.done=All done! I'll write this to the config file and send you on your way~

start.missing.secret=Your secret appears to be absent from your config! Don't worry, I'll generate one for you, just be mindful not to remove it in the future...
start.missing.host=You don't have a host set in your config. Please tell me one, or nothing will work! ;-;
start.missing.username=You seem to have disappeared from the config! Who are you again?
start.missing.password=You uhh... You don\'t have a password. Please set it before you continue.

login.welcome=Welcome to **Prism**
login.username.placeholder=Username
login.password.placeholder=Password
login.button=Sign In
